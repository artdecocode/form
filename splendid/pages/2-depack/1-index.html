# Compilation With Depack

<p>
  The module was compiled with _Depack_: the website bundler that runs Google Closure Compiler. The command for creating the bundle is:
</p>

```json
{
  "depack": "depack example/App.jsx -o splendid/js/main.js -I 2018 -a -H -p -w"
}
```

where the advanced compilation is set, as well as Preact's `h` pragma added to the beginning of each file. `-p` is for pretty printing, and `-w` for no warnings. _Depack_ then performs static-analysis on the entered files, and creates a temp directory where it transpiles JSX files.
