## Development Server

The development server is setup with the
<NPMBadge package="@idio/frontend" version="1.4.0">
  @idio/_FrontEnd_
</NPMBadge>
middleware that serves the source files as modules with JSX transpiled using <NPMBadge package="@a-la/jsx" version="1.4.0">
  @a-la/_JSX_
</NPMBadge>. This allows to change source code files and serve them as native modules that the modern browser understands.

<Code src="example/example.jsx" />

The server code itself is written in JSX thanks to the Ã€LaMode's require hook. The JSX's _VNode_ tree is then transformed into HTML with `preact-render-to-string`.

<Code src="example/index.js" />

The example can be started with `yarn example/` command:

```sh
MacBook:form zavr$ yarn example/
yarn run v1.13.0
$ yarn e example/example
$ node example example/example
http://localhost:5000
```
